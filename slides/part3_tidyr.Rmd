## So what's a tibble, anyway?

Tibbles _are_ data frames, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier. 

To learn more, check out `vignette("tibble")`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Creating tibbles 

Almost all of the functions in tidyverse produce tibbles, as tibbles are one of the unifying features of the tidyverse. Most other R packages use regular data frames, so you might want to coerce a data frame to a tibble. You can do that with `as_tibble()`:

```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```

## Creating tibbles

You can create a new tibble from individual vectors with `tibble()`. `tibble()` will automatically recycle inputs of length 1, and allows you to refer to variables that you just created, as shown below.

```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

## Differences from `data.frame()`

If you're already familiar with `data.frame()`, note that `tibble()` does much less: it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), it never changes the names of variables, and it never creates row names.

## tibble column names 

It's possible for a tibble to have column names that are not valid R variable names, aka __non-syntactic__ names. For example, they might not start with a letter, or they might contain unusual characters like a space. To refer to these variables, you need to surround them with backticks, `` ` ``:

```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```

You'll also need the backticks when working with these variables in other packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.


## Tibbles vs. data.frame

There are two main differences in the usage of a tibble vs. a classic `data.frame`: printing and subsetting.

## Printing

Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. This makes it much easier to work with large data. In addition to its name, each column reports its type, a nice feature borrowed from `str()`:

```{r}
tibble(
  a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
  b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
  c = 1:1e3,
  d = runif(1e3),
  e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
)
```

Tibbles are designed so that you don't accidentally overwhelm your console when you print large data frames. But sometimes you need more output than the default display. There are a few options that can help.

First, you can explicitly `print()` the data frame and control the number of rows (`n`) and the `width` of the display. `width = Inf` will display all columns:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  print(n = 10, width = Inf)
```




## Data import with readr 

If you're used to base R, you've probably used functions from the `foreign` package to read in `.dta` Stata files, `.csv` files, and other data formats. `foreign` isn't really that bad, but `readr` plays nicely with the tidyverse, is a little more flexible, and can be a lot faster. 

## Getting started

Most of readr's functions are concerned with turning flat files into data frames:

* `read_csv()` reads comma delimited files, `read_csv2()` reads semicolon
  separated files (common in countries where `,` is used as the decimal place),
  `read_tsv()` reads tab delimited files, and `read_delim()` reads in files
  with any delimiter.

* `read_fwf()` reads fixed width files. You can specify fields either by their
  widths with `fwf_widths()` or their position with `fwf_positions()`.
  `read_table()` reads a common variation of fixed width files where columns
  are separated by white space.


## Arguments 

The first argument to `read_csv()` is the most important: it's the path to the file to read.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
heights <- read_csv("data/heights.csv")
```

When you run `read_csv()` it prints out a column specification that gives the name and type of each column. 

## First line defaults to colnames, but you can change that 


1.  Sometimes there are a few lines of metadata at the top of the file. You can
    use `skip = n` to skip the first `n` lines; or use `comment = "#"` to drop
    all lines that start with (e.g.) `#`.
    
    ```{r}
    read_csv("The first line of metadata
      The second line of metadata
      x,y,z
      1,2,3", skip = 2)
    
    read_csv("# A comment I want to skip
      x,y,z
      1,2,3", comment = "#")
    ```

## First line defaults to colnames, but you can change that 
    
    
1.  The data might not have column names. You can use `col_names = FALSE` to
    tell `read_csv()` not to treat the first row as headings, and instead
    label them sequentially from `X1` to `Xn`:
    
    ```{r}
    read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = FALSE)
    ```
    
## First line defaults to colnames, but you can change that 

    
    Alternatively you can pass `col_names` a character vector which will be
    used as the column names:
    
    ```{r}
    read_csv("1,2,3\n4,5,6", col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))
    ```

## You might need to fix NAs. 

Another option that commonly needs tweaking is `na`: this specifies the value (or values) that are used to represent missing values in your file:

```{r}
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2,.", na = ".")
```

This is all you need to know to read ~75% of CSV files that you'll encounter in practice. You can also easily adapt what you've learned to read tab separated files with `read_tsv()` and fixed width files with `read_fwf()`. To read in more challenging files, you'll need to learn more about how readr parses each column, turning them into R vectors.


## Parsing

readr has lots of specialized tools for parsing different kinds of data at import. If you're already working with nicely cleaned data, you won't need to learn all of these. If you often work with data in non-standard formats, from Arabic-speaking countries, or from the distant past, check out [the relevant sections of R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#parsing-a-vector).

## Parsing decimals across cultures

```{r}
parse_double("1.23")
parse_double("1,23", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
```

## Clean junk out of your numbers

`parse_number()` addresses the second problem: it ignores non-numeric characters before and after the number. This is particularly useful for currencies and percentages, but also works to extract numbers embedded in text.

```{r}
parse_number("$100")
parse_number("20%")
parse_number("It cost $123.45")
```

## God, currency data is awful 

The final problem is addressed by the combination of `parse_number()` and the locale as `parse_number()` will ignore the "grouping mark":

```{r}
# Used in America
parse_number("$123,456,789")

# Used in many parts of Europe
parse_number("123.456.789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "."))

# Used in Switzerland
parse_number("123'456'789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "'"))
```

## Study up on your own on character encoding

## Factors

R uses factors to represent categorical variables that have a known set of possible values. Give `parse_factor()` a vector of known `levels` to generate a warning whenever an unexpected value is present:

```{r}
fruit <- c("apple", "banana")
parse_factor(c("apple", "banana", "bananana"), levels = fruit)
```


## Dates, date-times, and times 

You pick between three parsers depending on whether you want a date (the number of days since 1970-01-01), a date-time (the number of seconds since midnight 1970-01-01), or a time (the number of seconds since midnight). When called without any additional arguments:

*   `parse_datetime()` expects an ISO8601 date-time. ISO8601 is an
    international standard in which the components of a date are
    organised from biggest to smallest: year, month, day, hour, minute, 
    second.
    
    ```{r}
    parse_datetime("2010-10-01T2010")
    # If time is omitted, it will be set to midnight
    parse_datetime("20101010")
    ```
    
## Dates, date-times, and times 

*   `parse_date()` expects a four digit year, a `-` or `/`, the month, a `-` 
    or `/`, then the day:
    
    ```{r}
    parse_date("2010-10-01")
    ```

## Dates, date-times, and times 

*   `parse_time()` expects the hour, `:`, minutes, optionally `:` and seconds, 
    and an optional am/pm specifier:
  
    ```{r}
    library(hms)
    parse_time("01:10 am")
    parse_time("20:10:01")
    ```
 
## Dates, date-times, and times 
    
    Base R doesn't have a great built in class for time data, so we use 
    the one provided in the hms package.


## Other types of data

* __haven__ reads SPSS, Stata, and SAS files.

* __readxl__ reads excel files (both `.xls` and `.xlsx`).

* __DBI__, along with a database specific backend (e.g. __RMySQL__, 
  __RSQLite__, __RPostgreSQL__ etc) allows you to run SQL queries against a 
  database and return a data frame.

For hierarchical data: use __jsonlite__ (by Jeroen Ooms) for json, and __xml2__ for XML. Jenny Bryan has some excellent worked examples at <https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/>.

For other file types, try the [R data import/export manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html) and the [__rio__](https://github.com/leeper/rio) package.

## Tidy data

## Hadley has jokes

> "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its
> own way." --– Leo Tolstoy

> "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its
> own way." --– Hadley Wickham



## Tidy data

You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways. The example below shows the same data organised in four different ways. Each dataset shows the same values of four variables *country*, *year*, *population*, and *cases*, but each dataset organises the values in a different way.

## Table 1

```{r}
table1

```

## Table 2
```{r}
table2

```

## Table 3
```{r}
table3
```

## Table 4
```{r}
# Spread across two tibbles
table4a  # cases
table4b  # population
```




## Tidy data principles 

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

1.  Each variable must have its own column.
1.  Each observation must have its own row.
1.  Each value must have its own cell.


## Tidy data principles

## Tidy data principles 

These three rules are interrelated because it's impossible to only satisfy two of the three. That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

1.  Put each dataset in a tibble.
1.  Put each variable in a column.


## Tidy data principles 

- Every data task will be different, but tidy data principles will help you keep organized
- Much of your workflow will be getting data inputs into a tidy format
- From the beginning, lay out what you need your dataset to look like to do the analyses you want, then work backward from there
- [Hadley's vignette on tidy data principles](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
- [Chapter of R for Data Science on tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)


## Tidy data has

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## Tidy data does not have 
- Column headers are values, not variable names.
- Multiple variables are stored in one column.
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.


## Long vs wide data

## Relational data 
- Some data has structures more complex than simple tables
- For example, Netflix has a database where each user has a table of movies they've watched and a separate table for each movie of the users who have watched it
- This is "relational data"
- It's often, but not always, big 
- Requires special tools, usually SQL 


## Checking up on your data cleaning
- glance at your data: 
    - `View()` (but be careful!)
    - `summary()` (be careful on big datasets)
    - `head()` and `tail()`
    - `tibble::glimpse()`
    - `is.na()` and `sum(is.na())`



## Spreading and gathering

The principles of tidy data seem so obvious that you might wonder if you'll ever encounter a dataset that isn't tidy. Unfortunately, however, most data that you will encounter will be untidy. There are two main reasons:

1.  Most people aren't familiar with the principles of tidy data, and it's hard
    to derive them yourself unless you spend a _lot_ of time working with data.
    
1.  Data is often organised to facilitate some use other than analysis. For 
    example, data is often organised to make entry as easy as possible.
    
## Common problems 

1. One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

1. One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

Typically a dataset will only suffer from one of these problems; it'll only suffer from both if you're really unlucky! To fix these problems, you'll need the two most important functions in tidyr: `gather()` and `spread()`.

## Gathering

A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but _values_ of a variable. Take `table4a`: the column names `1999` and `2000` represent values of the `year` variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
table4a
```

## Gathering

To tidy a dataset like this, we need to __gather__ those columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

* The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In this example, 
  those are the columns `1999` and `2000`.

* The name of the variable whose values form the column names. I call that
  the `key`, and here it is `year`.

* The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. I call 
  that `value`, and here it's the number of `cases`.
  
## Gathering

Together those parameters generate the call to `gather()`:

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

The columns to gather are specified with `dplyr::select()` style notation. Here there are only two columns, so we list them individually. Note that "1999" and "2000" are non-syntactic names (because they don't start with a letter) so we have to surround them in backticks. 

## Gathering

![](../images/tidy-9.png)


## Gathering

In the final result, the gathered columns are dropped, and we get new `key` and `value` columns. 

To combine the tidied versions of `table4a` and `table4b` into a single tibble, we need to use `dplyr::left_join()`, which you'll learn about in [relational data].

```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```

## Spreading

Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For example, take `table2`: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

```{r}
table2
```

To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

* The column that contains variable names, the `key` column. Here, it's 
  `type`.

* The column that contains values forms multiple variables, the `value`
  column. Here it's `count`.

## Spreading

Once we've figured that out, we can use `spread()`, as shown programmatically below, and visually in Figure \@ref(fig:tidy-spread).

```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```

```{r tidy-spread, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spreading `table2` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-8.png")
```

As you might have guessed from the common `key` and `value` arguments, `spread()` and `gather()` are complements. `gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer; `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.


## Separating and uniting

So far you've learned how to tidy `table2` and `table4`, but not `table3`. `table3` has a different problem: we have one column (`rate`) that contains two variables (`cases` and `population`). To fix this problem, we'll need the `separate()` function. You'll also learn about the complement of `separate()`: `unite()`, which you use if a single variable is spread across multiple columns.

## Separate

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. Take `table3`:

```{r}
table3
```

## Separate

The `rate` column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables. `separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tidy-separate) and the code below.

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

## Separate

By default, `separate()` will split values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character (i.e. a character that isn't a number or letter). For example, in the code above, `separate()` split the values of `rate` at the forward slash characters. If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the `sep` argument of `separate()`. For example, we could rewrite the code above as:

```{r eval = FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```


## Unite

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. You'll need it much less frequently than `separate()`, but it's still a useful tool to have in your back pocket.

```{r tidy-unite, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Uniting `table5` makes it tidy"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-18.png")
```


## Unite

We can use `unite()` to rejoin the *century* and *year* columns that we created in the last example. That data is saved as `tidyr::table5`. `unite()` takes a data frame, the name of the new variable to create, and a set of columns to combine, again specified in `dplyr::select()` style:

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year)
```


## Missing values

Changing the representation of a dataset brings up an important subtlety of missing values. Surprisingly, a value can be missing in one of two possible ways:

* __Explicitly__, i.e. flagged with `NA`.
* __Implicitly__, i.e. simply not present in the data.



```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return)
```

## Missing values

Because these explicit missing values may not be important in other representations of the data, you can set `na.rm = TRUE` in `gather()` to turn explicit missing values implicit:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## Missing values

Another important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data is `complete()`:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```

## Missing values

`complete()` takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit `NA`s where necessary.
