## The workflow: modeling 

![](../images/data-science-explore.png)

## How do I do tidy data analysis? 

Everything we've seen so far has been relatively complete. The final part of the tidyverse that's under the most development is modeling. 

Two packages that help so far

- infer, for tidy hypothesis tests
- broom, to tidy regression output



## Data preparation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
set.seed(2017)
fli_small <- flights %>% 
  sample_n(size = 500) %>% 
  mutate(half_year = case_when(
    between(month, 1, 6) ~ "h1",
    between(month, 7, 12) ~ "h2"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(day_hour = case_when(
    between(hour, 1, 12) ~ "morning",
    between(hour, 13, 24) ~ "not morning"
  )) %>% 
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay, half_year, 
         day_hour, origin, carrier)
```

## Data preparation

* Two numeric - `arr_delay`, `dep_delay`
* Two categories 
    - `half_year` (`"h1"`, `"h2"`), 
    - `day_hour` (`"morning"`, `"not morning"`)
* Three categories - `origin` (`"EWR"`, `"JFK"`, `"LGA"`)
* Sixteen categories - `carrier`

## Calculate observed statistic 

The recommended approach is to use `specify() %>% calculate()`:

```{r}
obs_t <- fli_small %>%
  specify(arr_delay ~ half_year) %>%
  calculate(stat = "t", order = c("h1", "h2"))
```

The observed $t$ statistic is `r obs_t`.


## Calculate observed statistic 

Or using `t_test` in `infer`

```{r}
obs_t <- fli_small %>% 
  t_test(formula = arr_delay ~ half_year, alternative = "two_sided",
         order = c("h1", "h2")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(statistic) %>% 
  dplyr::pull()
```

The observed $t$ statistic is `r obs_t`.


## Calculate observed statistic 

Or using another shortcut function in `infer`:

```{r}
obs_t <- fli_small %>% 
  t_stat(formula = arr_delay ~ half_year, order = c("h1", "h2"))
```

The observed $t$ statistic is `r obs_t`.


## Data preparation - chi-square

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
set.seed(2017)
fli_small <- flights %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  sample_n(size = 500) %>% 
  mutate(season = case_when(
    month %in% c(10:12, 1:3) ~ "winter",
    month %in% c(4:9) ~ "summer"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(day_hour = case_when(
    between(hour, 1, 12) ~ "morning",
    between(hour, 13, 24) ~ "not morning"
  )) %>% 
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay, season, 
         day_hour, origin, carrier)
```


## Calculate observed statistic 

The recommended approach is to use `specify() %>% calculate()`:

```{r}
obs_chisq <- fli_small %>%
  specify(origin ~ season) %>% # alt: response = origin, explanatory = season
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")
```

The observed $\chi^2$ statistic is `r obs_chisq`.


## Calculate observed statistic 

Or using `chisq_test` in `infer`

```{r}
obs_chisq <- fli_small %>% 
  chisq_test(formula = origin ~ season) %>% 
  dplyr::select(statistic)
```

Again, the observed $\chi^2$ statistic is `r obs_chisq`.

## Calculate observed statistic 

Or using another shortcut function in `infer`:

```{r}
obs_chisq <- fli_small %>% 
  chisq_stat(formula = origin ~ season)
```

Lastly, the observed $\chi^2$ statistic is `r obs_chisq`.


```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

## broom: let's tidy up a bit


The broom package takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as `lm`, `nls`, or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.


## Tidying functions

* `tidy`: constructs a data frame that summarizes the model's statistical findings. This includes coefficients and p-values for each term in a regression, per-cluster information in clustering applications, or per-test information for `multtest` functions.
* `augment`: add columns to the original data that was modeled. This includes predictions, residuals, and cluster assignments.
* `glance`: construct a concise *one-row* summary of the model. This typically contains values such as R^2, adjusted R^2, and residual standard error that are computed once for the entire model.


## Example 

```{r lmfit}
lmfit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
lmfit
summary(lmfit)
```

## Tidy the output 

Instead, you can use the `tidy` function, from the broom package, on the fit:

```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(lmfit)
```

## Tidy the output 

This gives you a data.frame representation. Note that the row names have been moved into a column called `term`, and the column names are simple and consistent (and can be accessed using `$`).

## Augment the output 

Instead of viewing the coefficients, you might be interested in the fitted values and residuals for each of the original points in the regression. For this, use `augment`, which augments the original data with information from the model:

```{r}
augment(lmfit)
```

Note that each of the new columns begins with a `.` (to avoid overwriting any of the original columns).

## Glance at the output 


Finally, several summary statistics are computed for the entire regression, such as R^2 and the F-statistic. These can be accessed with the `glance` function:

```{r}
glance(lmfit)
```



## Generalized linear and non-linear models

These functions apply equally well to the output from `glm`:

```{r glmfit}
glmfit <- glm(am ~ wt, mtcars, family="binomial")
tidy(glmfit)
augment(glmfit)
glance(glmfit)
```

## Generalized linear and non-linear models


These functions also work on other fits, such as nonlinear models (`nls`):

```{r}
nlsfit <- nls(mpg ~ k / wt + b, mtcars, start=list(k=1, b=0))
tidy(nlsfit)
augment(nlsfit, mtcars)
glance(nlsfit)
```

## Hypothesis testing

The `tidy` function can also be applied to `htest` objects, such as those output by popular built-in functions like `t.test`, `cor.test`, and `wilcox.test`.

```{r ttest}
tt <- t.test(wt ~ am, mtcars)
tidy(tt)
```

## Hypothesis testing

Some cases might have fewer columns (for example, no confidence interval):

```{r}
wt <- wilcox.test(wt ~ am, mtcars)
tidy(wt)
```

## Hypothesis testing

Since the `tidy` output is already only one row, `glance` returns the same output:

```{r}
glance(tt)
glance(wt)
```
