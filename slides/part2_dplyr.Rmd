## The tidyverse: Let's get organized          
          
## A new and changing set of tools

- An "opinionated" set of R packages
- A dogma about "tidy" data organization and code
- Rigid but the best current approach for a lot of reasons

## Core packages

## Core packages

- `ggplot2` - visualization
- `dplyr` - data wrangling
- `tidyr` - data cleaning and tidying
- `readr` - read in data
- `purrr` - functional programming
- `tibble` - tidy version of data frames
- `stringr` - strings and text 
- `forcats` - better living through factors

## Others that play well with tidyverse (partial list)

- `broom` - tidy model outputs
- `lubridate` - work with dates and times
- `httr` - scrape web APIs
- `rvest` - web scraping

## The tidyverse is constantly evolving

- It's an official RStudio product, so watch their website
- Easy install and load:
  - `install.packages(tidyverse)`
  - `library(tidyverse)`
  
  
## The holy text of the tidyverse

## This workshop is a partial walkthrough of R4DS

- Adding in additional lessons on some of my favorite tidy analysis tasks
- Focus on `dplyr` 





# Read data: `readr`

- Can largely replace `foreign` for reading in data
- Advantages: Speed, flexibility, customization










## Verbs and pipes

## Visualize data: `ggplot2`

## The grammar of graphics
- `ggplot2` is the subject of its own workshop
- It plays very nicely with tidy data


## Pipe into `ggplot()`
