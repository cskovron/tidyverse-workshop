# Exercises: Basics and Comparisons

1.  Find all flights that

    1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
    1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
    1. Were operated by United, American, or Delta
    1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    1. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
    1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

1.  Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do?
    Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous 
    challenges?

1.  How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are 
    missing? What might these rows represent?

1.  Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing?
    Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general
    rule?  (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)



### Exercises: `arrange()`

1.  How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start?
    (Hint: use `is.na()`).
    
1.  Sort `flights` to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that
    left earliest.

1.  Sort `flights` to find the fastest flights.

1.  Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?


### Exercises: `select()`

1.  Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`,
    `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.
    
1.  What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in
    a `select()` call?
  
1.  What does the `one_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction
    with this vector?
    
    ```{r}
    vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
    ```
    
1.  Does the result of running the following code surprise you?  How do the
    select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    select(flights, contains("TIME"))
    ```

### Exercises: `mutate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
flights <- flights %>% mutate(
  dep_time = hour * 60 + minute,
  arr_time = (arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (arr_time %% 100),
  airtime2 = arr_time - dep_time,
  dep_sched = dep_time + dep_delay
)

ggplot(flights, aes(dep_sched)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 60)
ggplot(flights, aes(dep_sched %% 60)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
ggplot(flights, aes(air_time - airtime2)) + geom_histogram()
```

1.  Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but
    hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. 
    Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes
    since midnight.
    
1.  Compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see?
    What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?
    
1.  Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay`. How would you
    expect those three numbers to be related?

1.  Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want 
    to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for `min_rank()`.

1.  What does `1:3 + 1:10` return? Why?

1.  What trigonometric functions does R provide?



### Exercises: Grouped summaries 

1.  Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay 
    characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
    
    * A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of 
      the time.
      
    * A flight is always 10 minutes late.

    * A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of 
      the time.
      
    * 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it's 2 hours late.
    
    Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?

1.  Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as 
    `not_cancelled %>% count(dest)` and 
    `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using 
    `count()`).

1.  Our definition of cancelled flights (`is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)`
    ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

1.  Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern?
    Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

1.  Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the
    effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about
    `flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n())`)

1.  What does the `sort` argument to `count()` do. When might you use it?
